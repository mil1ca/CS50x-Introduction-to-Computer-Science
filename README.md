I made this repository to post my solutions to Harvard University's 2022 CS50x intro course assignments and document my progress during the course.

# DISCLAIMER:
Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself, it's totally pointless if you actually want to learn how to code and a blatant violation of the [Academic Honesty](https://docs.cs50.net/2016/fall/syllabus/cs50.html#academic-honesty) policy of the course.
